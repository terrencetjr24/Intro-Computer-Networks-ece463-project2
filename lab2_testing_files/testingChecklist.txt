Please briefly indicate the level of confidence you have in your code correctly executing each of the following test cases below. Feel free to append test cases of your own.

An example response would look like:
Basic 2_routers.conf Convergence: consistently gets correct routing table
Basic 5_routers.conf Convergence: does not always converge to correct routing tables
Basic 10_routers.conf Convergence: crashes once in a while

BASIC CONVERGENCE TEST CASES:
Basic 2_routers.conf Convergence:
Basic 4_routers.conf Convergence:
Basic 5_routers.conf Convergence:
Basic 10_routers.conf Convergence:

VALGRIND TEST CASE:
